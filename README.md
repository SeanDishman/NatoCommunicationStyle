This method of encoding is designed to be extremely secureâ€”unless someone feeds gigabytes of encoded data into a brute-force AI, it is virtually uncrackable. Why use this type of encoding? Because parts of the message remain partially readable using the default NATO phonetic alphabet, allowing the recipient to grasp some context even without fully decoding it. This balance enables sending messages that are both covert and somewhat understandable to trusted listeners, making it practical for communication where full secrecy isn't always necessary but some level of confusion for outsiders is desired.
